Given the vast amount of ways that the brain can be affected by problems, no matter how small, there are dozens of different disorders that can all affect someone in ways unlike any other. Some of the more popular illnesses include those such as anxiety, a disorder that primarily affects the ability to distinguish the difference between what should and should not be feared; depression, an illness that limits the amount of happiness one can experience throughout their day to day lives; and ADHD, a problem that drastically limits the attention span of the sufferer. Whatever the case, these disorders may affect people in different ways and will often require everyone's own unique way of handling it and getting treated.</div><h2>Diagnosis of Mental illnesses</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;It can sometimes be quite difficult to accurately diagnose a mental disorder, but we do have trusted methods that have worked to identify a disorder. If you need or want to get diagnosed, there are a few options you could try. For deciding which option to go with, you should to consult with your doctor or a professional on the matter to see which method would work best for you.<br><br><b>1) Psychological Tests</b><br>This type of test is performed by psychologists or doctors, and will consist of a series of questions that may determine what kind of mental illness you may have. They may also consist of other forms of tests, such as those to test your ability to move certain muscles, remember things, or your involuntary movements, which could help diagnose illnesses outside of only the brain.<br><br><b>2) Lab Tests</b><br>Lab tests will typically have several different ways of diagnosing an illness, with some common methods including screenings and blood tests. Mental health screenings are very useful methods of noticing a mental illness, even before some of the symptoms have taken into affect. Blood tests are typically done to check the amount of nutrients, neurotransmitters, proteins, etc. circulating throughout your body, which could show signs of disorders, with some of the more commonly diagnosed via blood tests being depression and schizophrenia.<br><br><b>3) Physical Examinations</b><br>These tests are not typically done to directly diagnose mental illnesses, but are used to see if you may have other diseases or problems that could lead to or has led to you contracting a disorder. This is typically done by a doctor, who will use the test to get rid of possible causes to how you may be feeling that could be linked to other causes outside of just your brain.</div><br><br>";

This name implies that those with OCD may often experience certain obsessions, which could lead to very distressing and triggering feelings, and compulsions, actions that may be done to try and diminish the obsessions.

Anxiety disorders may differ from everyone who has it, leading some people to only experience anxious feelings because of certain things, and everyone will have their own ways of dealing with it. Unlike other disorders, the affects of anxiety and the treatment for it is generally understood. For anyone with anxiety, there are ways to treat it and control your feelings, and it is very much encouraged to get help to deal the problem.</div><h2>Types of Anxiety</h2><div class = 'text'>Despite the disorders often being generalized to only anxiety, there are numerous different types of anxiety disorders. Every type is generalized by its own way of inflicting fear onto the sufferer, with every variation affecting them in different ways.<br><br><b>1) Generalized Anxiety Disorder</b><br>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (commonly shortened to GAD) is a disorder that inflicts constant fear to the sufferer from several different things. Those with GAD may fear about everyday things such as their relationship, family, finances, etc., and may find it hard to do stop their worrying for certain things. This could often lead to several large periods where they may not be able to accomplish simple tasks because of the worry of an upcoming event or something that had already happened, and may make the person feel fatigued or tired after a long period of time.<br><br><b>2) Social Anxiety</b><br>This type of anxiety primarily causes people to experience panic or worry in social situations, often from the fear of being judged or disliked by others. The fear of socializing could lead to situations where the sufferer may try to avoid certain things that may require them to interact with other individuals. Social anxiety could drastically affect someone's life, limiting what they may be capable of doing because of that fear. This may stop them from being able to maintain a job or keep a steady relationship with family or a loved one, and could even lead to panic attacks in situations that make them to be especially fearful.<br><br><b>3) Panic Disorder</b><br>Panic disorder is characterized by the excessive and frequent occurences of panic attacks. These attacks may lead those experiencing it in a state of complete and uncontrollable fear which may include symptoms of shaking, faster heart rate, sweating, loss of breath, and parts of their bodies going numb. These periods can be terrifying for the person experiencing it and, in the most extreme cases, may make them feel unable to leave their own home out of fear of experiencing another one. For someone suffering from panic disorder, attacks may often be unpredictable and can occur at any moment, but, if associated with other disorders like social anxiety, may occur out of a certain situation. They may also feel the need to have a companion near them in case they experience another one, and may limit the amount of time they spend outside their homes because of the attacks.</div><h2>Difference Between Anxiety and General Fear<br></h2><div class = 'text'>Everyone in their lives will experience some form of fear, panic, or worry for a multitude of things. This could include anything from financial problems, family or relationship issues, jobs, etc. Additionally, you may also experience a panic attack out of fear of something, and may not want to do it as a result. This, however, does not mean that you have an anxiety disorder. It is common for everyone to experience these types of feelings, but those will an anxiety disorder will generally have all of those feelings elevated to a level that becomes uncontrollable, which could drastically affect their day to day lives. If you do, however, believe that the feelings you are experiencing are because of an anxiety disorder, your best option would be talk to your doctor, counselor, and anyone else that you trust to help make sure that you get the correct help that you need.</div><h2>How to Tell If You Have Anxiety</h2><div class = 'text'>All cases of anxiety are different and will almost always affect people in ways unlike others. Nevertheless, there are some ways to tell whether or not you may be experiencing some form of anxiety. Some signs that may indicate that include the constant reoccurence and fear of panic attacks, worry or fear about everyday tasks or upcoming events, shakiness or sweating while in tense situations, and faster heart rate and blood pressure in positions where it isn't exactly necessary or would cause the same reaction out of another individual. You may also sometimes feel as if you may be going crazy or a loss of breath and dizziness. You may think too much about certain situations that could involve socializing, speaking or performing in front of a large audience, or even leaving your own home. If any of these situations seem even relatively familiar as a part of your life and you feel as if they don't allow you to do certain things, your best option would be to reach out to any trusted individual and seek help from a professional, as this will generally help with being able to cope with these feelings.</div><h2>Anxiety in the Brain</h2><div class = 'text'>Within our brains, there is a small horseshoe shaped part within the top section of it known as the amygdala. This small part is responsible for our fight or flight response, which is triggered to alert you that you may be in danger of something. Once this signal is sent out, our bodies will react by raising our blood pressure, increasing our heart rate, and may make you feel frightened or scared. For those with anxiety disorders, their amygdala may often release this feelings in times that wouldn't be necessary, resulting in worry and panic attacks. Additionally, certain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, a chemical sent out to control your mood, may not be released as often throughout your brain, which could possibly be what leads to negative thoughts and feelings.</div><h2>Treatment</h2><div class = 'text'>Anxiety in general is a generally understood mental disorder, which as a result allows for us to have figured out ways to ease and control some of its affects it may have on us. Some of the common ways for dealing with anxiety include various different types of therapy, medication, and techniques that naturally calm you down such as yoga or meditation. With therapy, some of the common ways to get treated is by going to cognitive behavioural therapy, a type of therapy that tries several hands-on methods to help ease your stress, and psychotherapy, which relies more on talking with someone about anything to do with your daily life or your general stresses and worries. A common type of medication to be used is any type of benzodiazepines, a type of drug that primarily calms down the body and lowers the stress. Some benzodiazepines that may be prescribed include xanax, valium, klonopin, and others. Along with them, antidepressants may also be described to lessen any negative thoughts you may have as a result of your anxiety, which could ease some of the stress you may experience. The last common method for dealing with anxiety is meditation or other calming activities, which, if done right, could lower the fear and worry you may have, and can even be used to control any panic attacks without the use of drugs.</div><h2>Resources</h2><div class = 'text'><b><u>Mindshift</u></b><br>Mindshift is an app for both IOS and Android that you can use as a resource to help calm yourself down if you ever feel too anxious.

		content.innerHTML = "<h2>What is Depression?</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Depression is a severe mental illness that primarily affects the amount of happiness and enjoyment you may experience throughout your everyday life. Those suffering from a depressive period may lose enjoyment out of things they had previously loved to do and could lead to the constant feeling of neverending thoughts that directly impact how you view the world. This often leads to feelings of loneliness, helplessness, self-doubt, and uselessness. Unfortunately, depression is a very common problem, leaving anyone susceptible to its affects. If gone untreated, the impact of depression will generally worsen and, if left to linger long enough, could lead to self-harm and even attempts of suicide. Treatment for depression is fortunately widely available, and if you're experiencing any signs of it, it would be greatly encouraged to get help by a professional, even if the symptoms may not have fully developed. This could lead to the prevention of the illness to worsen, which could make for a much more difficult position to escape. For anyone suffering from depression, the best thing to do would be to get help from a psychologist or doctor and surround yourself with those you love and trust, as this will lead to the negative thoughts and feelings to be slightly lessened, and will provide an opportunity to save yourself from the grasp of the disorder.</div><h2>Symptoms of Depression</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Depression is a very common disorder, so knowing the symptoms could be very useful in determining if you may have it or not. Often times, those struggling with depression feel start to feel more fatigued or restless, which could either be the result of sleeping too much or too little because of their depression. You may often have trouble concentrating on things and you may have the tendency to forget important details you would generally remember. Some things that you had used to enjoy may start to feel bland, repetitive, or boring, and feelings of sadness, hopelessness, emptiness, or uselessness may start to affect you more often. All of these symptoms could eventually lead to anything from the constant aching of certain parts of your body, digestive problems, and headaches, and you could be at a greater risk of developing eating disorders. Lastly, if the affects have increased out of your control, you may start to have thoughts of self harm and suicide. If any of these symptoms seem familiar and you feel as if they have been affecting your day to day life, your best solution would be to seek help from a professional, as they will help you with getting through it.</div><h2>Causes</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;The exact cause of depression could be for numerous different reasons, as everyone may contract it out of their own experiences. Some common links to the cause of depression may include any of the following:<br><ul><li>Genetics</li><li>Alcohol or Drug Abuse</li><li>Traumatic Experiences</li><li>Abuse or Harassment of any form</li><li>Loss of a Loved One</li><li>Other Illnesses</li><li>Other Major Events</li></ul>Generally, if depression had not been linked to genetics, it will often come from the cause of any major events in your life which had made a large enough impact to affect you in such a way. However, there is no real definitive solution to the exact cause of the illness, and could most often come as the result of several things.</div><h2>Depression in the Brain</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Within our brains are billions of microscopic cells known as neurons which are used to transmit information across parts of our brains and bodies. As the result of certain situations, these neurons may tend to release certain chemicals known as neurotransmitters to other neurons which regulate everything from our mood, sleep cycle, and concentration. Out of these types of neurotransmitters are a kind known as monoamines, which include chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These chemicals are often linked to most of our mood and personality, providing us with feelings that make us feel good such as pride and happiness, and will regulate certain aspects of our bodies such as our heart rate or blood pressure. Too little of these monoamines will often lead to us feeling sad or down, and is often what depression is linked to. For those with depression, their neurons will generally be incapable of either producing, distributing, or receiving the chemicals, which is what leads to any of the negative thoughts you may have. Nevertheless, there are ways to treat the lack of these chemicals, which should lead to any negative thoughts and feelings to be caused by this to subside and deminish.</div><h2>Treatment</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Fortunately enough for anyone suffering from depression, there are ways that will help aleviate the illness and its affects and will help you with getting through your day to day life. These methods generally focus on allowing you to start feeling more enjoyment and happiness throughout your day to day life, and have worked to help thousands of people struggling with the illness. <br><br>One very helpful technique used to alleviate most feelings associated with depression is various types of therapy. Common types of therapy used will generally include those that are a part of psychotherapy, or any type of therapy that involve talking to someone else as a way of helping with any negative affects. Some types of psychotherapy that you may use for helping with depression include any of the following: <br><br><b>Cognitive Therapy</b> - used for helping control negative thoughts and feelings<br><br><b>Behavioral Therapy</b> - allows for bad habits in your behavior to be broken<br><br><b>Interpersonal Therapy</b> - focuses on any situations that have happened or are going on at the present and helps to stop any worry associated with these problems<br><br><b>Psychodynamic Therapy</b> - focuses on any personal conflicts you may have with yourself, either from you childhood or adult life<br><br><b>Somatic Therapies</b> - typically used to help connect your body with your mind, helping ease stress and worry<br><br><b>Dialectal Behavioral Therapy</b> - primarily focuses on helping ease your stress and emotions about any situations in your life<br><br>The main goal for therapy is to help with controlling and managing any negative thoughts and feelings within you, helping you understand what the problem is and allowing you to overcome it. This can allow for a massive improvement in your general feelings, providing opportunities to cope and control your depression as a whole.<br><br>Another common method for dealing with and helping lessen the affects of depression is by taking medication. As depression can often be linked to the lack of a certain neurotransmitter within your body, certain medications, most commonly reuptake inhibitors will try to allow your body to start producing more of that chemical, allowing you to start feeling more happiness. A common type of medication used with depression include antidepressants, with some that are most often used being Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (NRIs), Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (DRIs). Other types of antidepressants that are not reuptake inhibitors include tricyclic antidepressants, which blocks the production of certain neurotransmitters while increasing the amount of others; and tetracyclic antidepressants. Although these medications may not work for everybody, there is a chance that it will help you get through the problem, and being able to balance out enough medication with therapy can greatly improve your health.<br><br>The last method for treating depression, and often the best option out of everything else, is to try to adapt to a few lifestyle changes. These changes may include eating healthier, exercising regularly, getting a good amount of sleep, spending more time outdoors, listening to music, and just trying your best to hang out with friends or loved ones. These natural treatments have been shown to be incredibly powerful and useful methods of treating depression, and can often times be much more useful than taking medication. Doing these things may often lead to a more positive way of thinking and can greatly improve your feelings. It can be very difficult to start implementing these changes into your routine, but doing so can drastically improve your situation and will help you with being able to cope with your depression.</div><h2>Resources</h2><div class = 'text'><b><u>Crisis Hotlines</u></b><br>Depression can make you feel terrible and may often put you in a position where you could feel as if nothing in your life, including your own thoughts and feelings, are under your control. It could feel chaotic, and, if gone on long enough, could start making you think about self harm and suicide.

OCD is the name people will generally use rather than its actual name - obsessive compulsive disorder. This name implies that those with OCD may often experience certain obsessions, which could lead to very distressing and triggering feelings, and compulsions, actions that may be done to try and diminish the obsessions. The obsessions you may experience with OCD will generally be very disturbing which may lead to large amounts of discomfort, worry, or anxiety. These thoughts will often feel as if they may be out of your control and will take up large amounts of time out of their day. This could also lead to those with OCD to constantly repeat certain tasks, such as constantly rereading or doing the same task over again several times, out of the worry of a certain event happening as a result of not doing so. If this seems familiar to you, getting help from a professional is the best thing to do for yourself and will definitely help with easing the affects of the disorder.</div><h2>Types of OCD</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Obsessive Compulsive Disorder affects everyone in different ways, with everyone with it having their own obsessions and compulsions to handle. However, OCD is generally classified under six major sections that will generally describe the compulsions that one may experience as a result of the obsessions.<br><br><b>1) Checking</b><br>Checking OCD is a problem that will often lead to someone repeatedly checking something, even for hours, to ensure that nothing bad happens. This may be anything from bathing several times throughout the day, constantly checking to make sure something is off (e.g. oven or T.V.), or always needing to check if you had hurt anyone or annoyed them in any way. Not checking to make sure of something could make those suffering from it to feel uncomfortable or worried that something may happen as a result of not doing so, which is what leads them to possibly doing it for hours at a time.<br><br><b>2) Contamination</b><br>Contamination OCD is the most common type of OCD to encounter, affecting the majority of the people in the world who have it. This subset will typically make someone feel the urge to always stay clean and avoid anything that may have been exposed to any form of bacteria or germs. This may because of the fear of contracting a major illness as a result or dying because of touching that specific thing. Those with it will often do their best to avoid any public areas that could be dirty, such as bathrooms, and may also wear certain protection such as gloves to not allow for any germs to reach their skin. Contamination OCD is different from mysophobia (germaphobia) in the sense that mysophobes will try to avoid germs and other dirty substances out of the fear of the dirt and filth while those with contamination OCD will avoid it out of fear of what may come as a result of touching it.<br><br><b>3) Mental Contamination</b><br>Similar to contamination OCD, mental contamination OCD will often lead to the sufferer to constantly feel the need wash themselves to keep clean. However, mental contamination OCD will make someone do this as a result of dirtying one's thoughts or mind by doing so. This could often be because someone had harmed or hurt the sufferer, and doing anything associated with that person could make them feel as if they had contaminated or dirtied their mind. Furthermore, this could also be triggered by any thoughts or memories of that specific thing, leaving them to be exposed to more chances of getting contaminated. Those with contamination OCD may try to avoid going to certain places or touching certain things which could result in contaminating themselves.<br><br><b>4) Intrusive Thoughts</b><br>This type of OCD is often associated with the constant and reoccuring experiences of certain thoughts or feelings. These thoughts can be associated with anything in your life, including religion, violence, sexual urges, or death. This could lead someone to believe that the thoughts change them as a person and begin to lead down on themselves or be ashamed. In most cases, however, this is not true and the thoughts will often not define who you are outside of your mind. These thoughts could also lead to the urge to do something relating to them, and could make someone feel anxious or worried that they may continue with it. These thoughts and urges may come as obsessions, while some compulsions may be to get rid of anything in the area to stop yourself from continuing with the urges or blocking/distancing yourself in a way that may allow for you to be unable to do something.<br><br><b>5) Rumination OCD</b><br>Rumination OCD is a type of OCD that could lead to the sufferer experiencing large amounts of discomfort or worry over a certain thought or situation. This is generally where the stereotype around people with OCD constantly needing perfection with everything around them as those with rumination OCD may feel the need for things to always be organized or clean, which could lead to uncomfort or distress otherwise. Those with it may also ponder and worry about philosophical or existential topics, disturbing or intrusive thoughts, or other thoughts. This could result in some compulsions related to always needing to make sure that you wouldn't be able to harm anyone else, avoiding certain situations or places that could be triggering, or always trying to make sure that everything in your life is clean and organized. Because of these obsessions and compulsions, a person suffering from rumination OCD may spend long amounts of time thinking about or worrying about a certain thing, which could make them so preoccupied as to be unable to other things.<br><br><b>6) Hoarding</b><br>Those with OCD may experience a hard time discarding and getting rid of certain items which could lead to them being unable to get rid of certain possessions. The inability to discard certain things may be because of the fact that the item could be dirty, it holds memories from their past, or out of the fear that something bad could happen because they had gotten rid of it. Because of this, those with hoarding OCD may tend to accumulate large amounts of trash or objects of little value around their house as they would be unable to get rid of it.</div>";
