Given the vast amount of ways that the brain can be affected by problems, no matter how small, there are dozens of different disorders that can all affect someone in ways unlike any other. Some of the more popular illnesses include those such as anxiety, a disorder that primarily affects the ability to distinguish the difference between what should and should not be feared; depression, an illness that limits the amount of happiness one can experience throughout their day to day lives; and ADHD, a problem that drastically limits the attention span of the sufferer. Whatever the case, these disorders may affect people in different ways and will often require everyone's own unique way of handling it and getting treated.</div><h2>Diagnosis of Mental illnesses</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;It can sometimes be quite difficult to accurately diagnose a mental disorder, but we do have trusted methods that have worked to identify a disorder. If you need or want to get diagnosed, there are a few options you could try. For deciding which option to go with, you should to consult with your doctor or a professional on the matter to see which method would work best for you.<br><br><b>1) Psychological Tests</b><br>This type of test is performed by psychologists or doctors, and will consist of a series of questions that may determine what kind of mental illness you may have. They may also consist of other forms of tests, such as those to test your ability to move certain muscles, remember things, or your involuntary movements, which could help diagnose illnesses outside of only the brain.<br><br><b>2) Lab Tests</b><br>Lab tests will typically have several different ways of diagnosing an illness, with some common methods including screenings and blood tests. Mental health screenings are very useful methods of noticing a mental illness, even before some of the symptoms have taken into affect. Blood tests are typically done to check the amount of nutrients, neurotransmitters, proteins, etc. circulating throughout your body, which could show signs of disorders, with some of the more commonly diagnosed via blood tests being depression and schizophrenia.<br><br><b>3) Physical Examinations</b><br>These tests are not typically done to directly diagnose mental illnesses, but are used to see if you may have other diseases or problems that could lead to or has led to you contracting a disorder. This is typically done by a doctor, who will use the test to get rid of possible causes to how you may be feeling that could be linked to other causes outside of just your brain.</div><br><br>";

This often leads to feelings of loneliness, helplessness, self-doubt, and uselessness. Unfortunately, depression is a very common problem, leaving anyone susceptible to its affects.

OCD is the name people will generally use rather than its actual name - obsessive compulsive disorder. This name implies that those with OCD may often experience certain obsessions, which could lead to very distressing and triggering feelings, and compulsions, actions that may be done to try and diminish the obsessions.

Despite the Hyperactivity in the name, children with ADHD may not experience symptoms of hyperactivity and will generally only have trouble focusing on specific things. This type of ADHD is generally known as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). Although ADD is a subset of ADHD, that doesn't exactly mean that they are the same thing or that one is the other, despite popular belief.

Anxiety disorders may differ from everyone who has it, leading some people to only experience anxious feelings because of certain things, and everyone will have their own ways of dealing with it. Unlike other disorders, the affects of anxiety and the treatment for it is generally understood. For anyone with anxiety, there are ways to treat it and control your feelings, and it is very much encouraged to get help to deal the problem.</div><h2>Types of Anxiety</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Despite the disorders often being generalized to only anxiety, there are numerous different types of anxiety disorders. Every type is generalized by its own way of inflicting fear onto the sufferer, with every variation affecting them in different ways.<br><br><b>1) Generalized Anxiety Disorder</b><br>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (commonly shortened to GAD) is a disorder that inflicts constant fear to the sufferer from several different things. Those with GAD may fear about everyday things such as their relationship, family, finances, etc., and may find it hard to do stop their worrying for certain things. This could often lead to several large periods where they may not be able to accomplish simple tasks because of the worry of an upcoming event or something that had already happened, and may make the person feel fatigued or tired after a long period of time.<br><br><b>2) Social Anxiety</b><br>This type of anxiety primarily causes people to experience panic or worry in social situations, often from the fear of being judged or disliked by others. The fear of socializing could lead to situations where the sufferer may try to avoid certain things that may require them to interact with other individuals. Social anxiety could drastically affect someone's life, limiting what they may be capable of doing because of that fear. This may stop them from being able to maintain a job or keep a steady relationship with family or a loved one, and could even lead to panic attacks in situations that make them to be especially fearful.<br><br><b>3) Panic Disorder</b><br>Panic disorder is characterized by the excessive and frequent occurences of panic attacks. These attacks may lead those experiencing it in a state of complete and uncontrollable fear which may include symptoms of shaking, faster heart rate, sweating, loss of breath, and parts of their bodies going numb. These periods can be terrifying for the person experiencing it and, in the most extreme cases, may make them feel unable to leave their own home out of fear of experiencing another one. For someone suffering from panic disorder, attacks may often be unpredictable and can occur at any moment, but, if associated with other disorders like social anxiety, may occur out of a certain situation. They may also feel the need to have a companion near them in case they experience another one, and may limit the amount of time they spend outside their homes because of the attacks.</div><h2>Difference Between Anxiety and General Fear<br></h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Everyone in their lives will experience some form of fear, panic, or worry for a multitude of things. This could include anything from financial problems, family or relationship issues, jobs, etc. Additionally, you may also experience a panic attack out of fear of something, and may not want to do it as a result. This, however, does not mean that you have an anxiety disorder. It is common for everyone to experience these types of feelings, but those will an anxiety disorder will generally have all of those feelings elevated to a level that becomes uncontrollable, which could drastically affect their day to day lives. If you do, however, believe that the feelings you are experiencing are because of an anxiety disorder, your best option would be talk to your doctor, counselor, and anyone else that you trust to help make sure that you get the correct help that you need.</div><h2>How to Tell If You Have Anxiety</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;All cases of anxiety are different and will almost always affect people in ways unlike others. Nevertheless, there are some ways to tell whether or not you may be experiencing some form of anxiety. Some signs that may indicate that include the constant reoccurence and fear of panic attacks, worry or fear about everyday tasks or upcoming events, shakiness or sweating while in tense situations, and faster heart rate and blood pressure in positions where it isn't exactly necessary or would cause the same reaction out of another individual. You may also sometimes feel as if you may be going crazy or a loss of breath and dizziness. You may think too much about certain situations that could involve socializing, speaking or performing in front of a large audience, or even leaving your own home. If any of these situations seem even relatively familiar as a part of your life and you feel as if they don't allow you to do certain things, your best option would be to reach out to any trusted individual and seek help from a professional, as this will generally help with being able to cope with these feelings.</div><h2>Anxiety in the Brain</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Within our brains, there is a small horseshoe shaped part within the top section of it known as the amygdala. This small part is responsible for our fight or flight response, which is triggered to alert you that you may be in danger of something. Once this signal is sent out, our bodies will react by raising our blood pressure, increasing our heart rate, and may make you feel frightened or scared. For those with anxiety disorders, their amygdala may often release this feelings in times that wouldn't be necessary, resulting in worry and panic attacks. Additionally, certain neurotransmitters such as serotonin, a chemical sent out to control your mood, may not be released as often throughout your brain, which could possibly be what leads to negative thoughts and feelings.</div><h2>Treatment</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Anxiety in general is a generally understood mental disorder, which as a result allows for us to have figured out ways to ease and control some of its affects it may have on us. Some of the common ways for dealing with anxiety include various different types of therapy, medication, and techniques that naturally calm you down such as yoga or meditation. With therapy, some of the common ways to get treated is by going to cognitive behavioural therapy, a type of therapy that tries several hands-on methods to help ease your stress, and psychotherapy, which relies more on talking with someone about anything to do with your daily life or your general stresses and worries. A common type of medication to be used is any type of benzodiazepines, a type of drug that primarily calms down the body and lowers the stress. Some benzodiazepines that may be prescribed include xanax, valium, klonopin, and others. Along with them, antidepressants may also be described to lessen any negative thoughts you may have as a result of your anxiety, which could ease some of the stress you may experience. The last common method for dealing with anxiety is meditation or other calming activities, which, if done right, could lower the fear and worry you may have, and can even be used to control any panic attacks without the use of drugs.</div><h2>Resources</h2><div class = 'text'><b><u>Mindshift</u></b><br>Mindshift is an app for both IOS and Android that you can use as a resource to help calm yourself down if you ever feel too anxious.

This often leads to feelings of loneliness, helplessness, self-doubt, and uselessness. Unfortunately, depression is a very common problem, leaving anyone susceptible to its affects. If gone untreated, the impact of depression will generally worsen and, if left to linger long enough, could lead to self-harm and even attempts of suicide. Treatment for depression is fortunately widely available, and if you're experiencing any signs of it, it would be greatly encouraged to get help by a professional, even if the symptoms may not have fully developed. This could lead to the prevention of the illness to worsen, which could make for a much more difficult position to escape. For anyone suffering from depression, the best thing to do would be to get help from a psychologist or doctor and surround yourself with those you love and trust, as this will lead to the negative thoughts and feelings to be slightly lessened, and will provide an opportunity to save yourself from the grasp of the disorder.</div><h2>Symptoms of Depression</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Depression is a very common disorder, so knowing the symptoms could be very useful in determining if you may have it or not. Often times, those struggling with depression feel start to feel more fatigued or restless, which could either be the result of sleeping too much or too little because of their depression. You may often have trouble concentrating on things and you may have the tendency to forget important details you would generally remember. Some things that you had used to enjoy may start to feel bland, repetitive, or boring, and feelings of sadness, hopelessness, emptiness, or uselessness may start to affect you more often. All of these symptoms could eventually lead to anything from the constant aching of certain parts of your body, digestive problems, and headaches, and you could be at a greater risk of developing eating disorders. Lastly, if the affects have increased out of your control, you may start to have thoughts of self harm and suicide. If any of these symptoms seem familiar and you feel as if they have been affecting your day to day life, your best solution would be to seek help from a professional, as they will help you with getting through it.</div><h2>Causes</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;The exact cause of depression could be for numerous different reasons, as everyone may contract it out of their own experiences. Some common links to the cause of depression may include any of the following:<br><ul><li>Genetics</li><li>Alcohol or Drug Abuse</li><li>Traumatic Experiences</li><li>Abuse or Harassment of any form</li><li>Loss of a Loved One</li><li>Other Illnesses</li><li>Other Major Events</li></ul>Generally, if depression had not been linked to genetics, it will often come from the cause of any major events in your life which had made a large enough impact to affect you in such a way. However, there is no real definitive solution to the exact cause of the illness, and could most often come as the result of several things.</div><h2>Depression in the Brain</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Within our brains are billions of microscopic cells known as neurons which are used to transmit information across parts of our brains and bodies. As the result of certain situations, these neurons may tend to release certain chemicals known as neurotransmitters to other neurons which regulate everything from our mood, sleep cycle, and concentration. Out of these types of neurotransmitters are a kind known as monoamines, which include chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These chemicals are often linked to most of our mood and personality, providing us with feelings that make us feel good such as pride and happiness, and will regulate certain aspects of our bodies such as our heart rate or blood pressure. Too little of these monoamines will often lead to us feeling sad or down, and is often what depression is linked to. For those with depression, their neurons will generally be incapable of either producing, distributing, or receiving the chemicals, which is what leads to any of the negative thoughts you may have. Nevertheless, there are ways to treat the lack of these chemicals, which should lead to any negative thoughts and feelings to be caused by this to subside and deminish.</div><h2>Treatment</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Fortunately enough for anyone suffering from depression, there are ways that will help aleviate the illness and its affects and will help you with getting through your day to day life. These methods generally focus on allowing you to start feeling more enjoyment and happiness throughout your day to day life, and have worked to help thousands of people struggling with the illness. <br><br>One very helpful technique used to alleviate most feelings associated with depression is various types of therapy. Common types of therapy used will generally include those that are a part of psychotherapy, or any type of therapy that involve talking to someone else as a way of helping with any negative affects. Some types of psychotherapy that you may use for helping with depression include any of the following: <br><br><b>Cognitive Therapy</b> - used for helping control negative thoughts and feelings<br><br><b>Behavioral Therapy</b> - allows for bad habits in your behavior to be broken<br><br><b>Interpersonal Therapy</b> - focuses on any situations that have happened or are going on at the present and helps to stop any worry associated with these problems<br><br><b>Psychodynamic Therapy</b> - focuses on any personal conflicts you may have with yourself, either from you childhood or adult life<br><br><b>Somatic Therapies</b> - typically used to help connect your body with your mind, helping ease stress and worry<br><br><b>Dialectal Behavioral Therapy</b> - primarily focuses on helping ease your stress and emotions about any situations in your life<br><br>The main goal for therapy is to help with controlling and managing any negative thoughts and feelings within you, helping you understand what the problem is and allowing you to overcome it. This can allow for a massive improvement in your general feelings, providing opportunities to cope and control your depression as a whole.<br><br>Another common method for dealing with and helping lessen the affects of depression is by taking medication. As depression can often be linked to the lack of a certain neurotransmitter within your body, certain medications, most commonly reuptake inhibitors will try to allow your body to start producing more of that chemical, allowing you to start feeling more happiness. A common type of medication used with depression include antidepressants, with some that are most often used being Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (NRIs), Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (DRIs). Other types of antidepressants that are not reuptake inhibitors include tricyclic antidepressants, which blocks the production of certain neurotransmitters while increasing the amount of others; and tetracyclic antidepressants. Although these medications may not work for everybody, there is a chance that it will help you get through the problem, and being able to balance out enough medication with therapy can greatly improve your health.<br><br>The last method for treating depression, and often the best option out of everything else, is to try to adapt to a few lifestyle changes. These changes may include eating healthier, exercising regularly, getting a good amount of sleep, spending more time outdoors, listening to music, and just trying your best to hang out with friends or loved ones. These natural treatments have been shown to be incredibly powerful and useful methods of treating depression, and can often times be much more useful than taking medication. Doing these things may often lead to a more positive way of thinking and can greatly improve your feelings. It can be very difficult to start implementing these changes into your routine, but doing so can drastically improve your situation and will help you with being able to cope with your depression.</div><h2>Resources</h2><div class = 'text'><b><u>Crisis Hotlines</u></b><br>Depression can make you feel terrible and may often put you in a position where you could feel as if nothing in your life, including your own thoughts and feelings, are under your control.

		content.innerHTML = "<h2>What is OCD?</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (typically shortened to UCD) is a mental disorder that can affect anyone in their day to day lives, and unlike popular belief, is not primarily based around the constant need for perfectionism. OCD is the name people will generally use rather than its actual name - obsessive compulsive disorder. This name implies that those with OCD may often experience certain obsessions, which could lead to very distressing and triggering feelings, and compulsions, actions that may be done to try and diminish the obsessions. The obsessions you may experience with OCD will generally be very disturbing which may lead to large amounts of discomfort, worry, or anxiety. These thoughts will often feel as if they may be out of your control and will take up large amounts of time out of their day. This could also lead to those with OCD to constantly repeat certain tasks, such as constantly rereading or doing the same task over again several times, out of the worry of a certain event happening as a result of not doing so. If this seems familiar to you, getting help from a professional is the best thing to do for yourself and will definitely help with easing the affects of the disorder.</div><h2>Types of OCD</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Obsessive Compulsive Disorder affects everyone in different ways, with everyone with it having their own obsessions and compulsions to handle. However, OCD is generally classified under six major sections that will generally describe the compulsions that one may experience as a result of the obsessions.<br><br><b>1) Checking</b><br>Checking OCD is a problem that will often lead to someone repeatedly checking something, even for hours, to ensure that nothing bad happens. This may be anything from bathing several times throughout the day, constantly checking to make sure something is off (e.g. oven or T.V.), or always needing to check if you had hurt anyone or annoyed them in any way. Not checking to make sure of something could make those suffering from it to feel uncomfortable or worried that something may happen as a result of not doing so, which is what leads them to possibly doing it for hours at a time.<br><br><b>2) Contamination</b><br>Contamination OCD is the most common type of OCD to encounter, affecting the majority of the people in the world who have it. This subset will typically make someone feel the urge to always stay clean and avoid anything that may have been exposed to any form of bacteria or germs. This may because of the fear of contracting a major illness as a result or dying because of touching that specific thing. Those with it will often do their best to avoid any public areas that could be dirty, such as bathrooms, and may also wear certain protection such as gloves to not allow for any germs to reach their skin. Contamination OCD is different from mysophobia (germaphobia) in the sense that mysophobes will try to avoid germs and other dirty substances out of the fear of the dirt and filth while those with contamination OCD will avoid it out of fear of what may come as a result of touching it.<br><br><b>3) Mental Contamination</b><br>Similar to contamination OCD, mental contamination OCD will often lead to the sufferer to constantly feel the need wash themselves to keep clean. However, mental contamination OCD will make someone do this as a result of dirtying one's thoughts or mind by doing so. This could often be because someone had harmed or hurt the sufferer, and doing anything associated with that person could make them feel as if they had contaminated or dirtied their mind. Furthermore, this could also be triggered by any thoughts or memories of that specific thing, leaving them to be exposed to more chances of getting contaminated. Those with contamination OCD may try to avoid going to certain places or touching certain things which could result in contaminating themselves.<br><br><b>4) Intrusive Thoughts</b><br>This type of OCD is often associated with the constant and reoccuring experiences of certain thoughts or feelings. These thoughts can be associated with anything in your life, including religion, violence, sexual urges, or death. This could lead someone to believe that the thoughts change them as a person and begin to lead down on themselves or be ashamed. In most cases, however, this is not true and the thoughts will often not define who you are outside of your mind. These thoughts could also lead to the urge to do something relating to them, and could make someone feel anxious or worried that they may continue with it. These thoughts and urges may come as obsessions, while some compulsions may be to get rid of anything in the area to stop yourself from continuing with the urges or blocking/distancing yourself in a way that may allow for you to be unable to do something.<br><br><b>5) Rumination OCD</b><br>Rumination OCD is a type of OCD that could lead to the sufferer experiencing large amounts of discomfort or worry over a certain thought or situation. This is generally where the stereotype around people with OCD constantly needing perfection with everything around them as those with rumination OCD may feel the need for things to always be organized or clean, which could lead to uncomfort or distress otherwise. Those with it may also ponder and worry about philosophical or existential topics, disturbing or intrusive thoughts, or other thoughts. This could result in some compulsions related to always needing to make sure that you wouldn't be able to harm anyone else, avoiding certain situations or places that could be triggering, or always trying to make sure that everything in your life is clean and organized. Because of these obsessions and compulsions, a person suffering from rumination OCD may spend long amounts of time thinking about or worrying about a certain thing, which could make them so preoccupied as to be unable to other things.<br><br><b>6) Hoarding</b><br>Those with OCD may experience a hard time discarding and getting rid of certain items which could lead to them being unable to get rid of certain possessions. The inability to discard certain things may be because of the fact that the item could be dirty, it holds memories from their past, or out of the fear that something bad could happen because they had gotten rid of it. Because of this, those with hoarding OCD may tend to accumulate large amounts of trash or objects of little value around their house as they would be unable to get rid of it.</div><h2>Causes</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;The exact cause of OCD is generally unknown as it is a very complex disorder which we have only recently started researching. Nevertheless, some research has shown that there are certain things that link to the cause of it.<br><br>As with most other psychological disorders, OCD is often directly associated with your genetics. For those with parents who have or have had OCD throughout their lives, the chances of them contracting the disorder themselves is drastically higher than those who don't have family links to it. Developing OCD as a child or adolescent is much more probable in boys, but girls have been shown to have a higher chance of developing it at a later age.<br><br>Although not always the direct cause of OCD, the way one had been raised by their parents or gaurdians could worsen the affects of the disorder. For those raised in very strict households, they may have experienced more stress in their lives, which could cause more worry or discomfort about certain things. By exposing someone at childhood to a large amount of stress, they may not be able to understand good habits apart from the bad, which could lead to some obsessions or compulsions associated with or caused by OCD.<br><br>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a mental disorder. What this means that the affects of the illness is generally caused by problems that occur in the brain, with certain parts of your brain affecting you in different ways. OCD has been linked to a lack of the neurotransmitter (chemical within your brain) serotonin, which primarily controls your general mood and happiness you may experience. Other neurotransmitters affected by OCD include dopamine and glutamate, with all three of the chemicals aiding in the communication and transmission of certain signals throughout your brain. For the larger parts of the brain, sections such as the cortex, striatum, and thalamus have been shown to have difficulty communicating with each other. These sections are generally the areas that are responsible for you to experience different behaviors and habits, and a lack of communication between them may be what leads to the constant and repetitive actions you may experience suffering from OCD.</div><h2>Treatment</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;Although OCD is a mental illness that we still don't understand too much about, some treatments for the disorder have been developed that have been shown to help people suffering from it.<br><br>One of the most useful methods out of all others is primarily the Exposure and Response Prevention (also known as ERP). The primary goal for ERP is to help allow you to understand your obsessions and trying to deal with them in a better way by easing your compulsions or getting rid of them entirely. The therapy will help you with trying to create steps to take for figuring out how to gradually lessen the affects of your specific problem, and will allow you to slowly and surely get treated. This will often be done with the help of a therapist, who would help you along the entire way with treating your OCD. ERP is the most important aspect of getting past your compulsions and obsessions, and will more than likely be recommended by a doctor if you have been diagnosed.<br><br>Alongside the ERP therapy, other types of therapy can be helpful in addition to it. A common type of therapy used for treating OCD is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The goal of CBT is to allow for you to have a different perspective on your illness by changing your general attitude and thoughts about it. The therapy will try to put the control back into the person with the illness rather than allowing the disorder to take control itself, doing so by exposing you to your problems and difficulties in your life. Unlike other types of therapies, it takes quite a short time to finish, only spanning across roughly a few months.<br><br>Although not the most effective method, taking medication has been shown to help with easing the urges and triggers you may have as a result of your OCD. Different types of antidepressants will generally be prescribed for the disorder, with different medication being given for different ages. Popular types of antidepressants are most often Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) which work to try and provide more of the serotonin neurotransmitter throughout your brain and body, allowing for better communication within your brain and a more positive mood.</div><h2>Resources</h2><div class = 'text'><b><u>International OCD Foundation</u></b><br>The International OCD Foundation is an online resource that provides an abundance of information on OCD as an illness and ways to treat it.

		content.innerHTML = "<h2>What is ADHD?</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is one of the most common psychological disorders among children, with some studies suggesting that roughly 11% of the children worldwide may have it. As its name suggests, ADHD will typically affect your ability to focus or pay attention on one thing for a large amount of time and may make you feel more active or energetic than others. Despite the Hyperactivity in the name, children with ADHD may not experience symptoms of hyperactivity and will generally only have trouble focusing on specific things. This type of ADHD is generally known as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). Although ADD is a subset of ADHD, that doesn't exactly mean that they are the same thing or that one is the other, despite popular belief. Similar to other disorders, ADHD has been shown to affect people in different ways, which could allow some people to be capable of focusing on certain tasks while others may have large amounts of trouble doing so.</div><h2>Types of ADHD</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;As ADHD is generally looked at as one disorder with little to no additional subtypes, the different affects of the disorder have been divided among three seperate subtypes of the illness.<br><br><b>1) Inattentive ADHD</b><br>Inattentive ADHD is the type most often associated with ADD, where as you will often find it difficult to focus on a specific task, although you may not feel very energetic or hyperactive. Rather than being disruptive as a result of the disorder, you may often forget or miss certain details, have trouble focusing on something, it may be more difficult to learn new things or follow directions, or daydreaming often. Inattentive ADHD will typically only be diagnosed if the effects of your symptoms are severe enough to affect you throughout your everyday life, and will most often be diagnosed via a medical exam.<br><br><b>2) Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD</b><br>Hyperactive-impulsive ADHD is a type of the disorder that will often make you feel restless or energetic most or all the time. Those with it may feel the constant urge to run around, fidget, talk excessively, and you may have a smaller amount of patience compared to others. Although the hyperactivity may make it difficult to focus on something, those with hyperactive-impulsive ADHD will not show too many of the same signs as those with inattentive ADHD when it comes to paying attention or listening to someone, and will mainly only be affected by the constant need of movement.<br><br><b>3) Combined Type ADHD</b><br>Combined type ADHD is a type of the disorder that combines the symptoms of both inattentive ADHD and hyper-impulsive ADHD. With it, you will often feel the need to move around constantly or talk excessively while being unable to pay attention or focus on a specific task. This type of ADHD is the most common type of the disorder, and is often the stereotypical way of describing ADHD.</div><h2>Diagnosis</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;ADHD is a difficult disorder to diagnose, and will typically have several requirements to be properly diagnosed. This is because most of the symptoms displayed in the illness are common symptoms for other problems, allowing for there to be numerous different disorders possible to be diagnosed rather than ADHD.<br><br>One of the most prominent methods used for diagnosis of the disorder is via the requirements provided in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (commonly referred to as DSM-5). This resource sets a standard for what is generally required to be diagnosed with ADHD, with the criteria having been worked on by hundreds of professional to create. For ADHD, the DSM-5 divides the criteria among the 3 different subtypes - inattentive, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined - with different requirements for each type.<br><br>For inattentive ADHD, you must display at least 6 of the following symptoms if you're under 17 or 5 if you're 17 or older:<br><ul><li>You have difficulty staying focused on a certain task or activites</li><li>It is easy for you to miss small details or you make easy mistakes</li><li>You will often not follow the rules</li><li>You will often daydream or not pay attention while someone is talking to you</li><li>You may find it difficult to stay organized</li><li>You easily forget things</li><li>You lose things a lot</li><li>You find it hard to stay focused on repetitive or tedious tasks that may take a long amount of time to complete</li><li>You are easily distracted</li></ul><br><br>For hyperactive-impulsive ADHD, you would need to have at least 6 of the following symptoms if you are 16 or younger or 5 if you are 17 or older:<br><ul><li>You often fidget or squirm while sitting down</li><li>You tend to get up in situations where you need to remained seated</li><li>You often feel the need to run around or climb on things (most often for children)</li><li>You are impatient</li><li>You talk excessively</li><li>It is hard for you to stay in one place for a long amount of time</li><li>You will often interrupt people while in the middle of a task or while speaking</li><li>You will often try to complete people's sentences while they are talking</li><br><br>To be diagnosed with combined ADHD, you need to display at least 6 symptoms from the criteria of both the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types. Additionally, the DSM-5 requires that the symptoms had been present before the age of 12 and had continued past that age, you display them in several different locations, they interfere with your daily life, and they are not the cause of any other mental disorder.</div><h2>Causes</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;The exact cause of ADHD is still very much unknown to most scientists as there is no definitive situation where the disorder will always occur. Nevertheless, certain things have been linked to those suffering from the illness, which could allow for a general understanding of where it may come from.<br><br>One thing that may be the cause of ADHD could be the exposure to certain substances. Studies have shown that smoking or drinking during pregnancy could affect the development of the fetus, with this exposure having been shown to make for a higher chance of the child contracting ADHD. Other chemicals in foods have also been shown to leave kids at a higher chance of contracting the disorder, and most often when exposed to lead, children may contract ADHD as a result. The exposure to all of these substances will often harm certain aspects of the brain, with the damage being shown to often be the cause of the disorder.<br><br>Although not enough research has been acquired to make a definitive statement about whether it has a correlation with the development of ADHD, certain brain injuries, if very severe, may be the cause of certain children developing the disorder. Some common injuries, such as concussions, have been observed to greaten the chance of someone developing some form of ADHD. The link between the two is still being researched, so it is still difficult to tell whether ADHD is affected by the injuries.<br><br>Within our brains are certain chemicals released by our neurons, the cells used for communication throughout our bodies and brains, to control different aspects of our personalities and feelings. Dopamine and norepinephrine are two neurotransmitters used for the regulation of our mood, with dopamine providing feelings of happiness and pride while norepinephrine will provide feelings of worry and is generally associated with our fight or flights responses. In the brains of those suffering from ADHD, it has been seen that there is a lack of these chemicals, which could be the reason that the disorder may provide feelings of discomfort or restlessness in certain situations.</div><h2>Hyperfocus</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;ADHD (primarily inattentive ADHD) is knwon to make someone unable to focus or provide constant effort into a single task for a sustained amount of time. The common stereotype for the disorder is that the sufferer will always get distracted by certain things outside of what they may be doing at a certain moment and will be unable to stay focused on that task. However, ADHD has been shown to make someone capable of hyperfocusing on a specific task. Contrary to the stereotype, hyperfocus will allow the person with ADHD to be able to sit for hours while only focusing on a specific task or situation. What you would be able to hyperfocus on is generally based on your own interests, with certain things that get you excited, curious, or happy allowing you to do so. Hyperfocus will lead someone to direct all their attention towards that task for a long period of time, often leaving them unable to direct their focus on something else without interruptions by any external distractions (e.g. someone calling your name or a very loud sound). Hyperfocus has also been shown to initiate when under extreme stress, allowing someone with ADHD to be able to intensely focus on finishing a certain assignment if left with little time to do so. Although not necessarily a bad thing, hyperfocus may be distruptive in certain situations, and could lead the person doing so to forget important things or be late for certain events. If you are able to control it, however, it could be a very useful skill for being able to complete tasks or focus on important things.</div><h2>Treatment</h2><div class = 'text'>&emsp;There are currently several methods that have been shown to help ease the affects of ADHD. Everyone with ADHD will react differently to each method, so even though they have been shown to help, certain people may feel that certain things will work better than others.<br><br><b>1) Medication</b><br>Although not a very good method for dealing with ADHD, certain drugs can be prescribed to help ease some of its affects. The most popular medication prescribed by doctors will generally include different stimulants, which may improve the alertness, attention, or energy of an individual. Other types of drugs used for treating the disorder include different non-stimulants and, even though little research has been shown that it helps with treatment, different anti-depressants. Medication can sometimes have various side effects that could harm the person taking it, so it is generally not the best method for dealing with ADHD.<br><br><b>2) Natural Treatments</b><br>As with other mental disorders, various activies can help with allowing someone to cope with their ADHD easier. These methods may include different lifestyle changes, with things such as developing and following a sleep schedule, limiting the amount of time on electronic devices, or developing certain routines have been shown to drastically help with ADHD. Other methods such as eating healthier, meditating or doing yoga, exercising, or providing several indications as to not forget imporant things may also help with allowing someone to ease the affects of the disorder.<br><br><b>3) Therapy</b><br>One very helpful type of therapy commonly used when coping with ADHD is behavioral therapy. This method will try to allow the sufferer to be able to recognize and control their habits and behavior, aiding in being able to have better control over your actions. Unlike medication, behavioral therapy has been shown to drastically improve the situation with ADHD even after the therapy finishes, making it a very useful and important aspect of being able to cope with it. Going to behavioral therapy has shown to help with going to school, stay focused on their tasks (even if they find it boring), and doing other things that the ADHD may have interfered with.</div><h2>Resources</h2><div class = 'text'><b><u>ADHD Europe</u></b><br>ADHD Europe is a website designed to help out those suffering from ADHD throughout Europe.
